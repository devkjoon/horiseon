# Challenge 1

## Description

This project was modified to clear up unnecessary code by replacing with semantic elements. By cleaning these elements up, the code is easily accessible to new users and anybody wanting to view.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Changes

## HTML

* Changed multiple div elements to header and footer elements to comply with semantic code.
* Reorganized to code to ease of access and user friendly elements.
* Added alt descriptions to src elements

## CSS

* Altered class selectors in accordance to altered HTML elements
* Added descriptive comments for selectors in CSS
